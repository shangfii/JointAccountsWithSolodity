# Joint Savings Account Overview

This project Automates the creation of joint savings accounts, by creating a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses.
These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account

# Technologies 

a. python: This project makes great use of python version 3.8.5 with the following packages and modules:

2. pandas - version 1.3.2 - To manipulate and create dataframes.

3. hashlib-  A common interface to many different secure hash and message digest algorithms. In our case; SHA256 to return a hexdigest.

4. web3.py - A Python library for connecting and performing operations on Ethereum-based blockchain.


b. Solidity -  A programing language to create smart contracts and implement the joints saving application to work with ether.

c. Remix IDE (not a python module)- For writing and editing of solidity formatted code, and launched the our application.
